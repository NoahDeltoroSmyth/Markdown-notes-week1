Find your "what you want"

Don't BS your way through. Be honest...You don't have to fake it.

How did you go about finding your first job? What inclined you to go where you went? Was it based on your wants or what came up first?

Don't look to blame anyone or anything for how difficult things can be. Advocate for yourself

Go outside and take a walk. Write down what you want on a sticky note to remind yourself why you are here. Don't neglect yourself. Take a shower.

Remind yourself why you chose to make this career switch.

Make a plan first thing. Remember to do the basic necessities.
